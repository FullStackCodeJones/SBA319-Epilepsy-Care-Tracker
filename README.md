Epilepsy Tracker & Support App
About This Project
This project is a deeply personal and meaningful endeavor for me. As a mother of a daughter diagnosed with epilepsy, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it can be to manage and cope with seizures, medication, and the fear of the unknown. This app was created out of love and necessity to provide a tool that can help others in similar situations.

This Epilepsy Tracker & Support App was designed with the purpose of helping people with epilepsy, their families, and caregivers better track seizure occurrences, medications, and emergency contacts. It’s not just a functional tool—it’s my way of offering support and spreading awareness about epilepsy, creating a space where people can feel heard, understood, and empowered.

My daughter’s diagnosis of epilepsy was a turning point for me—what started as focal seizures eventually led to more serious, longer episodes. As a parent, I often felt helpless during these episodes, and finding effective treatments became a journey. After trying many things, she now takes pharmaceutical medication, but I believe we can do more. I hope that this app can be a helpful resource for others in similar situations.

Through this project, I’ve merged my personal connection to the cause with my passion for software engineering. It’s been a learning experience that has allowed me to showcase my skills in a meaningful way while also making a positive impact on the community.
